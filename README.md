# Basic Calculator Program
This Python program performs basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division) based on user input.
# Features
**Addition:** Adds two numbers provided by the user.
**Subtraction:** Subtracts the second number from the first number.
**Multiplication:** Multiplies two numbers provided by the user.
**Division:** Divides the first number by the second number, with a check to prevent division by zero.
# How to Use
**Step 1:-** Enter Numbers:
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers (they can be integers or floating-point numbers).
Choose Operation:

**Step 2:-** After entering the numbers, the user is presented with four operation options:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Input Operation:

**Step 3:-** The user inputs the operation number (1, 2, 3, or 4) to perform the desired arithmetic operation.

# Output:
The program calculates and displays the result of the chosen operation.
If division is selected and the second number is zero, the program will alert the user that division by zero is not possible.
